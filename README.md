# SabespMananciais

App to check the levels of SÃ£o Paulo's main reservoirs.

I really say thanks to @wbruno (https://github.com/wbruno?tab=repositories) and @rpresb (https://github.com/rpresb) to create and release the Sabesp API data (https://sabesp-api.herokuapp.com), which is really useful for general public, especially developers.
